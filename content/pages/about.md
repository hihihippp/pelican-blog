### About this blog

This blog will feature posts on statistics, data visualization and machine learning from time to time. It's intended as a personal notebook of some sort, as well as hopefully being of some interest to readers. 

### About me

I'm a graduate student at the University of California, Merced, where I study [Cognitive and Information Sciences](http://www.cogsci.ucmerced.edu) in the Interactive Cognition Lab. My advisors at UC Merced are [Teenie Matlock](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/tmatlock/) and [Rick Dale](http://www.cognaction.com/rick).

### What do I do?

One of my main interests lies in experimental cognitive linguistics, where I study the mental processing involved in understanding **figurative language** such as fictive motion. I use a variety of methods ranging from behavioral experiments to analyzing gestures and natural language processing.

I am also interested in **language evolution** and language change. How have languages changed over time and why? I am specifically interested in socio-cultural influences, iterated learning and what has been termed experiential semiotics.
