Title: About Me

### Who am I?

I'm a graduate student at the University of California, Merced, where I study [Cognitive and Information Sciences](http://www.cogsci.ucmerced.edu) in the Interactive Cognition Lab. My advisors at UC Merced are [Teenie Matlock](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/tmatlock/) and [Rick Dale](http://www.cognaction.com/rick).

### What do I do?

One of my main interests lies in cognitive linguistics, where I study the mental processing involved in understanding **figurative language** such as fictive motion. I use a variety of methods ranging from behavioral experiments to analyzing gestures and text data.

I am also interested in **language evolution** and language change. How have languages changed over time and why? I am specifically interested in socio-cultural influences, iterated learning and what has been termed experiential semiotics.
